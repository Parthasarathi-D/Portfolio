## Projects
### Attendance with face recognition 
Our Face Recognition Attendance Management System offers a modern and efficient solution for tracking attendance in various settings such as schools, universities, and corporate environments. By harnessing the power of facial recognition technology, our system provides accurate and reliable attendance recording while streamlining administrative tasks.

#### Facial Enrollment:
Users, such as students or employees, enroll their faces into the system by capturing a series of images from different angles. These images are then used to create a unique facial template for each individual.

#### Real-Time Recognition:
During attendance sessions, the system captures live video feed from a camera and performs real-time facial recognition on detected faces. It compares the detected faces against the enrolled facial templates in the system's database.

#### Attendance Tracking:
Upon successful recognition, the system records the timestamp and the identity of the individual in the attendance database. This data can be accessed and analyzed by administrators to monitor attendance patterns and trends.

#### Accuracy and Security:
Our system employs state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms to ensure high accuracy in identifying individuals. Additionally, robust security measures are implemented to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Customizable Settings:
Administrators have the flexibility to customize various settings such as attendance thresholds, notification preferences, and access control policies to suit their specific requirements.

#### Database Management:
Enrolled facial templates and attendance records are stored securely in a database, ensuring efficient retrieval and management of data.

#### Integration with Hardware:
Our system seamlessly integrates with compatible hardware devices such as IP cameras or webcam-equipped terminals to capture live video feed for facial recognition.

#### User Interface:
We provide a user-friendly interface for both administrators and end-users to enroll faces, view attendance records, and configure system settings.

#### Client-Server Architecture: 
The application follows a client-server architecture, where the client-side interface interacts with the server-side components to facilitate file transfer operations. Communication between the client and server is managed through socket programming, ensuring reliable data transmission.

#### Multithreading: 
To optimize performance and responsiveness, the application utilizes multithreading techniques to handle concurrent file transfer requests. Separate threads are spawned for each file transfer operation, allowing the application to efficiently manage multiple transfers simultaneously without blocking the main UI thread.

#### Real-Time Progress Tracking:
Our application provides real-time feedback on file transfer operations, allowing users to monitor the progress of their downloads and uploads. Users can track the status of ongoing file transfers, including the transfer speed and remaining time, providing them with full visibility and control over the process.
